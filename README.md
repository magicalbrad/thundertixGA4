# Thundertix GA4 Google Analytics Tracking
Currently, it is difficult to track GA4 events in third party iframes, due to cross browser cookie blocking.
This makes it difficult to track events from embedded Thundertix ticketing windows. This is a sample
implementation of a way to get GA4 working through Google Tag manager using JavaScript postMessage for
cross-origin communication.

I don’t know whether this will actually be of use to anyone. I thought I’d share it as it took a bit of trial
and error for me to get it working, so maybe this will save someone else a few headaches. For now, I won’t put
a lot of detail, as I don’t know how useful to anyone else. I can more details later, if there is sufficient interest.
